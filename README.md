## Introduction

This code follows from my research in modeling the Cahn-Hilliard equation in both the forward and inverse directions.

## Files
CA2d-**Forward**.ipynb : Notebook for forward problem. Models 
CA2d-**Inverse**.ipynb : Notebook for inverse problem. Foward output .txt file formatted correctly for inverse input use $$(x, y, t)$$. Predicts epsilon from the data, which is defined in the forward case.
